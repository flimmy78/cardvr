This app can grab video from a web camera, and store it to .avi files. Mostly usefull in CAR PC systems.

Mostly important features:
1. Compressing by codecs (XVID, DIVX, etc)
2. Storing files by cycle, older files replaces by newer.
3. GPS info in each frame of video (speed, coordinates)
4. Auto start of recording on windows loading

PS: used AForge.NET library
